PSD3 Prototype
=======================

Coded using Ruby 1.9.x

Current database structure is based on 3 tables with certain fields each
users: name
courses: name, students (users registered for the course, not used/implemented yet)
sessions: date, course (name of course), attended (list of user names)

Run db_test2.db to generate an example database of users, courses, and sessions (with attendance data)
Feel free to modify to add more things
